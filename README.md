# Decentralized Artifact Registry
ðŸ“¦ Artifact Registry â€“ Decentralized Identity-Conscious System
A secure and modular MERN stack application built for Weblinear Technologies' Hackathon. This system enables authenticated users to manage personal digital artifacts (create, update, delete, view) within their own isolated identity environments, ensuring data privacy, temporal tracking, and soft deletion support.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
"Decentralized Identity-Conscious Artifact Registry with Temporal Mutability Constraints"
Design and implement a metadata-governed registry system that supports dynamic artifact provisioning in an identity-isolated environment. The system must ensure strict access control, session-aware transactional boundaries, temporal traceability, and lifecycle-bound object persistence.
